## “Time is out of order.”

### Prompt
“Time is out of order.” Design a small interaction, system, or visualization where time isn’t linear. What does that mean for input, output, or user navigation? Explore how GenAI could represent or reshape that logic.

### Goal  
Break away from linear time and reimagine the way UX/navigation is rendered and how GenAI will be applied.

### Approach  
**Concept:** Create an new gen personal diary concept where users can store and navigate personal moments in emotional time rather than chronological order. 

**Input** 
For this prototype the user will select the current emotion by clicking, but it is supposed to get data from your digital footprint or any data you feed it by speech, type or upload.

**Output** 
This could be visual or even immersive experience. For the task I am creating a UI/UX section that will be listening to the users speech and react based on the emotional tone. In the future, this can be some like below

**User Navigation:** Speech and Text input triggers a new moment, the UI/UX will listen to the user and render something back based on the topic

## What is “Emotional Time”?

"Emotional time" refers to the subjective experience of time when influenced by emotions, where strong feelings can distort one's perception of how quickly or slowly time passes. It's different from chronological time, as emotions can make time feel longer or shorter, and these feelings can persist long after the initial event. - Google Search (AI) Result

## Use Cases

- Therapy, users can explore their old adn present memories but also curate future memories based on stored data
- Friend, This can become an AI friend that will be there for you and know you more than you know yourself.
- Management, It can be sort of SCRUM board but digital

## How GenAI Comes In

GenAI can help by sorting these clusters however it wants. It can read memories and tag them with emotions. It can also cook up 'what-if' timelines, pulling from other memory clusters to guess future outcomes or similar results. It even groups similar feelings like nostalgia, pure joy, or trauma. And yeah, GenAI can whip up a therapy agent's look and feel based on the emotional tone.
